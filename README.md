# Hyperparameter Optimization
### Study and evaluation of techniques for the optimization of hyperparameters in machine learning algorithms (paper)
This project works using jupyter notebook, in Google Colab. If u want to use a local jupyter notebook instead of colab, u have to change the absolute paths to ur own paths.

The main file is "HiperOpt.ipynb". The comparative study has used the following datasets: Covertype Dataset, Adult Dataset and Bank Marketing Dataset. You can download them from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/)

"Documentation.pdf" is a pdf format file paper which explains all about the project.
